<h1> Studying Advice</h1>

<p>Much of the advice people give about studying is wrong.</p>
<p>Always study in the same place?</p>

<p style="color:red"> Wrong!</p>

<p>Study one topic intensively before going on to the next</p>

<p style="color:red"> Wrong!</p>

<p>Here are some study tips that are based on <strong>actual research</strong></p><br>

<h6>From<em>Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits, by Benedict Carey</em>, published in the <em>New York Times</em> on September 6, 2010.</h6>



<h2> Alternate study environments</h2>
<p>Study in the library, in the coffee shop, in your room, ...Varying the place you study helps you remember more.</p>

<h2>Mix content</h2>
<p>Study a bit of this, a bit of that, some this again, some of the other. Switching content helps you remember more.</p>


<h2> Space study sessions</h2>
<p>Three one-hour sessions is more effective than one three-hour session.</p>

<h2>Self-testing</h2>
<p>Test yourself, or have a buddy do it. It helps you know how well you know.</p><br>

<p>CoreDogs is good at this. That's what the review system is for. </p>
